Provides a [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) friendly API wrapper
for [MapboxGL-js](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/), A WebGL powered
vector and raster tile mapping library.

MapboxGL-js provides impressive vector tile rendering capabilities
that you can find out more about [here](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/).
Although the Mapbox
[vector tile specification](https://www.mapbox.com/developers/vector-tiles/) is
